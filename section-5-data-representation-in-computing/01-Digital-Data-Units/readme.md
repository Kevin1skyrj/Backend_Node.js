# 📊 Digital Data Units

## Overview

While we cannot measure the minimum distance or length of nature's creation, we can precisely measure the smallest units of data that humans have created.

---

## 🧱 Basic Units

- **Bit** - The smallest unit of data (1 Bit)
- **Nibble** - 4 bits = 1 Nibble (0.5 Byte)
- **Byte** - 8 bits = 1 Byte

## 📏 Measurement Standards

Data units are measured using two different standards:

### 🌍 SI (International System of Units)
**Based on Powers of 10**

| Unit | Definition | Power of 10 | Bytes |
|------|------------|-------------|-------|
| **Kilobyte (KB)** | 1 KB = 1,000 Bytes | $10^3$ | 1,000 |
| **Megabyte (MB)** | 1 MB = 1,000 KB | $10^6$ | 1,000,000 |
| **Gigabyte (GB)** | 1 GB = 1,000 MB | $10^9$ | 1,000,000,000 |
| **Terabyte (TB)** | 1 TB = 1,000 GB | $10^{12}$ | 1,000,000,000,000 |

### ⚡ IEC (International Electrotechnical Commission)
**Based on Powers of 2**

| Unit | Definition | Power of 2 | Bytes |
|------|------------|------------|-------|
| **Kibibyte (KiB)** | 1 KiB = 1,024 Bytes | $2^{10}$ | 1,024 |
| **Mebibyte (MiB)** | 1 MiB = 1,024 KiB | $2^{20}$ | 1,048,576 |
| **Gibibyte (GiB)** | 1 GiB = 1,024 MiB | $2^{30}$ | 1,073,741,824 |
| **Tebibyte (TiB)** | 1 TiB = 1,024 GiB | $2^{40}$ | 1,099,511,627,776 |

---

## 🔍 Key Differences

| Aspect | SI Units | IEC Units |
|--------|----------|-----------|
| **Base** | Powers of 10 | Powers of 2 |
| **Multiplier** | 1,000 | 1,024 |
| **Usage** | Marketing, Storage manufacturers | Computing systems, Memory |
| **Suffix** | -byte (KB, MB, GB) | -bibyte (KiB, MiB, GiB) |

## 💡 Important Notes

- SI units are commonly used by storage manufacturers (hard drives, SSDs)
- IEC units are more accurate for computing and memory calculations
- The difference becomes more significant as the units get larger
- Operating systems typically use IEC units (binary) while displaying storage
